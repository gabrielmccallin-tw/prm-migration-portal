# Migration Portal for Practices
`Proof of concept`

The Migration Portal is a web application that will be used by GP Practice Staff to manage a list of patients seen during a cutover. They can then request all of these patients to have updated data sent to the new supplier system via GP2GP and the Deductions datastore.
